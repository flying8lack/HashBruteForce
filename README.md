# HashBruteForce
Python Hash Cracker i built by myself for Hackthissite challanges, but could be used anywhere else :)


this software is owned and written by "flying8lack" using python, all it does is ask you to input hash type, hash, minimal posssible length of the
original password (put 0 if you don't know) and level of possiable characters.


available levels:
  level 1 - numbers only (0-9);\n
  level 2 - numbers and lower case alphabet (0-9 and a-z);\n
  level 3 - numbers, upper case alphabet and lower case alphabet (0-9, a-z and A-Z);\n
  level 4 - lowercase alphabet (a-z);\n
