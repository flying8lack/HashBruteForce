# Hash Brute Force
Python Hash Cracker, was built by myself for [Hackthissite](https://www.hackthissite.org/) challanges, but could be used anywhere else :)


this software is owned and written by **flying8lack** using python, all it does is ask you to input hash type, hash, minimal posssible length of the
original password (put 0 if you don't know) and level of possiable characters.
